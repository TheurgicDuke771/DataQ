"""Warehouse-native lineage — pull edges straight from the warehouse (#858, ADR 0034).

The catalog `LineageProvider` (`lineage.provider`, Marquez) exists to reconcile a
byte-mismatched identity we *cannot construct* (#823 — a producer spells a name in
some other case, so we must enumerate the catalog and fold). **This seam solves a
different, simpler problem and is therefore a distinct interface.** Querying the
warehouse directly returns identifiers in the engine's OWN case — Snowflake
`ACCOUNT_USAGE` returns UPPER, Unity Catalog `system.access` returns lower — which is
**byte-identical to `services.asset_identity`**. No enumerate-and-fold step, no
node-graph normalization: a warehouse provider runs SQL and yields
``(upstream_identity, downstream_identity)`` edge pairs directly.

The pull is **incremental where the source is a log** (UC `table_lineage` has an
`event_time` watermark) and **snapshot-diff where the source is current-state**
(Snowflake `OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` is a view, not a log — no event time, so its refresh
upserts + prunes by `last_seen` like the dbt path). Both write `lineage_edges` with a
real ``connection_id`` (the pull rides a datasource connection) — the non-NULL,
full-unique-constraint regime, so a Snowflake refresh never touches a UC or dbt row.

**Honest degradation (#828).** A warehouse offers lineage at tiers that vary by edition
and grant. The provider tries the richest available and reports **which tier answered**
so the UI can say a graph is view-level-only rather than paint a confident empty state.
The tier ladder and its live-verified behaviour are per-provider (see `snowflake.py`).
