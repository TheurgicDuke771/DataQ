## Week 1 — Foundation, auth & project scaffold

**Exit gate:** Azure AD auth working, GX + FastAPI connected to Snowflake DEV, Swagger live.

### Setup (4 tasks — 4/4 ✅)
- [x] ✅ Monorepo scaffold — FastAPI backend + React/Vite frontend + Celery + Redis — #37 + [PR 2a](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/39) + [PR 3c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/63)
- [x] ✅ Docker Compose dev environment (all services wired up) — [PR 2a](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/39)
- [x] ✅ PostgreSQL DB + Alembic migrations baseline — [PR 2c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/41)
- [x] ✅ Core data model: connections, suites, checks, runs, results, shares — [PR 2c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/41) _(also added `users`, `pipeline_runs`, `trigger_bindings` per ADR 0004)_

### Auth (3 tasks — 1.5/3 ✅, 1.5/3 🟡)
- [x] ✅ Azure AD SSO — MSAL token validation in FastAPI + login flow in React — [PR 3a](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/53) + [PR 3c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/63)
- [ ] 🟡 Session timeout + silent token refresh handling — `acquireTokenSilent` wired in PR 3c interceptor; `InteractionRequiredAuthError` fallback path pending (real-AAD smoke test in Week 7)
- [ ] 🟡 Key Vault integration for all credential storage — abstraction landed in [PR 3b](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/56); real Azure vault provisioning deferred to Week 7

### GX baseline & API conventions (3 tasks — 2/3 ✅, 1/3 🟡)
- [x] ✅ GX Core wired to Snowflake datasource (DEV env) — `SnowflakeCheckRunner` (GX 1.17) behind the `CheckRunner` seam — [PR 4b](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/76) + [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79) _(live run against DEV fails-soft pending creds — deferred smoke)_
- [x] ✅ GX result serialisation to DB (runs, results) — `run_service.execute_run` + NaN→null sanitizer — [PR 4c-i](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/78) + [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79)
- [ ] 🟡 Configure FastAPI with Pydantic models, route tags, and Swagger (`/docs`) + ReDoc (`/redoc`) — FastAPI + Pydantic wired; `/me` + `/_probe/*` have response models, tags, summaries; formal "disable in prod" gate still pending

**Week 1 total: 7.5 / 10 ✅** _(exit gate met; remaining: silent-token-refresh, real Key Vault, prod-docs gate — all deferred to Week 7)_

---

## Week 2 — Connection manager — all datasource types (backend)

**Exit gate:** All connection types configurable and testable via API; credentials stored in Key Vault.

> **Auth-boundary discipline (per [ADR 0010](adr/0010-provider-agnostic-infrastructure-seams.md)):** new connection-CRUD endpoints (and every protected route from here on) depend on a generic internal "current user" dependency that returns DataQ's own `User` — they must NOT read MSAL token claims directly in route/service code. Cheap now; expensive to retrofit once dozens of endpoints exist. No new abstraction layer required, just the boundary.

### Snowflake & ADF (4 tasks — 4/4)
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for Snowflake connections (DEV / QA / UAT), connection test endpoint — [PR 5](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/85) _(also introduced the `ConnectionAdapter` seam + registry per [ADR 0011](adr/0011-extensibility-seams-for-deferred-integrations.md), and `SecretStore.set` write-through — so PRs 6-8 are pure adapter additions)_
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for ADF connections (subscription ID + service principal) — PR 6 _(`ADFConnectionAdapter` in the new `orchestration/` package — NOT `datasources/`, per CLAUDE.md §4; `test()` does SP token + factory GET via httpx. Enforces `(type, env)` uniqueness for orchestrator rows via a **partial unique index** `WHERE type IN ('adf','airflow')` per [#72](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/72) / ADR 0004 — datasources excluded, so Snowflake stays many-per-env. CRUD/API reused unchanged: pure adapter + registry + migration addition.)_
- [x] ✅ Connection re-auth endpoint — refresh expired Key Vault token — `POST /connections/{id}/reauth` (`svc.reauth_connection`): rotates the credential through `SecretStore.set` **and** verifies it via the same adapter probe as `/test`, in one step (the gap PATCH+`/test` leave open). Rotation persists before the probe, so a bad new credential surfaces as 502 `connection_test_failed`; a store-write failure is 502 `connection_secret_write_failed` with the old credential untouched. 6 TestClient tests (rotate+verify ok, failed-verify-but-rotation-persists, write-fail 502, 404, secret-required 422). Type-agnostic — applies to all six connection types
- [x] ✅ Review `connections.secret_ref` nullability — decide based on Airflow basic-poll / unauthenticated S3 cases ([PR #41 nit](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/41)) — **decision: keep nullable.** It's NULL for the transient flush→secret-write window (create), for credential-less auth (managed-identity/IAM-role, W7, ADR 0010/0011), and for unauthenticated sources. v1 types are all secret-bearing, but presence is enforced in the **service layer** (`test_connection` → 502 without a credential), not the schema — so W7 credential-less modes need no later migration. Recorded as a comment on the `secret_ref` column in `db/models.py`

### ADF webhook receiver (Azure Monitor → DQ platform) (5 tasks — 3 ✅ / 1 🟡 / 1 ⬜)
- [x] ✅ `POST /api/v1/orchestration/events/adf` — receive Azure Monitor payload, validate shared secret (constant-time, ADR 0006), return 200 — PR 7 _(unified `OrchestrationProvider` seam landed: `orchestration/base.py` Protocol + `RunUpdate` DTO + provider registry; ADF reference impl per ADR 0004 — service code dispatches by provider, never branches on ADF)_
- [x] ✅ Parse webhook payload — `AdfProvider.parse_event` extracts `factoryName`/`pipelineName`/`runId`/`status`/`firedDateTime` → `RunUpdate`, ADF→`PIPELINE_RUN_STATUSES` normalisation — PR 7 _(exact Common-Alert-Schema field mapping validated at Week-7 deploy smoke)_
- [x] ✅ Follow-up ADF REST API call on webhook receipt — fetch run details — PR 8 _(`AdfProvider.fetch_run_detail` GETs the ARM `pipelineruns/{runId}` for authoritative status/timing/message; `orchestration_service.ingest_event` enriches **best-effort** before upsert — any failure (no creds, transport) falls back to the parsed event so a valid webhook is never dropped)_
- [ ] 🟡 Upsert pipeline run status into `pipeline_runs`; correlate with suite run — idempotent upsert (PR 7) + **trigger-on-success skeleton** (PR 8): a `succeeded` run matching enabled `trigger_bindings` creates queued `Run` rows (`triggered_by="<provider>:<pipeline>:<run_id>"`, idempotent on replay); failures never trigger (ADR 0004). **`run_suite` dispatch ungated** in Week 5 ([#215](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/215), PR-C0a — `Suite.target` + `run_target` resolver; `_trigger_suites` now `run_suite.delay`s each created run); `trigger_bindings` CRUD shipped ([#172](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/190)) — its UI is Week 5 ([#216](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/216)). `list_recent_runs` + 10-min polling beat shipped ([#171](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/189)).
- [x] ✅ Shared secret config in Key Vault → `ADF_WEBHOOK_SECRET` env var — `settings.adf_webhook_secret_name` resolved via `SecretStore` (→ `KV_SECRET_ADF_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in dev) — PR 7

### Airflow orchestration (added per ADR 0004; not in original roadmap) (3 tasks — 3/3)
- [x] ✅ `POST /api/v1/orchestration/events/airflow` — `AirflowProvider.parse_event` (signed-callback JSON → `RunUpdate`, state→`PIPELINE_RUN_STATUSES`) + **HMAC-SHA256** auth over the raw body (`X-DataQ-Signature`, [ADR 0007](adr/0007-airflow-callback-model.md)); reuses `ingest_event`. Generalised `_resolve_connection` to match on a provider-declared `resource_config_key` (`base_url` for Airflow, `factory_name` for ADF — no provider branching); enrichment is skipped for Airflow (callback is authoritative). `airflow-webhook-secret` config added
- [x] ✅ Airflow `on_success_callback` / `on_failure_callback` helper snippet for users' DAGs — stdlib-only, fail-safe `dataq_airflow_callback.py` under `integrations/airflow/` (+ setup README): HMAC-signs the raw body → `X-DataQ-Signature` and POSTs `dag_id`/`run_id`/`state`/`base_url` to the receiver. Round-trip tests assert the snippet's signature **and** payload are accepted by `_authenticate_airflow` + `AirflowProvider.parse_event` (producer↔consumer agreement) — completes the Airflow event-receiver loop (callback producer ↔ HMAC receiver)
- [x] ✅ Airflow connection type — webserver URL + token/basic auth (token v1 default) — `AirflowConnectionAdapter` (REST `dagRuns`-probe `test`), one-line registry add; orchestrator `(type,env)` guard already covers it ([ADR 0007](adr/0007-airflow-callback-model.md))

### Flat file — ADLS Gen2 & S3 (4 tasks — 2/4)
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for ADLS Gen2 connections — `AdlsConnectionAdapter` (account URL + container; SAS auth, container-properties `test` via `azure-storage-blob`), one-line registry add. **SAS only in v1**; `managed_identity` config rejected with a "deferred to Week 7" message (needs an ambient Azure identity + the `secret_ref`-nullability change) — [PR #100](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/100)
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for S3 connections — `S3ConnectionAdapter` (bucket + region; access-key auth, `head_bucket` `test` via `boto3`), one-line registry add. **Access-key only in v1**; `iam_role` config rejected with a "deferred to Week 7" message (per the same `secret_ref`-nullability decision)
- [ ] ⬜ GX `pandas_abs` / `pandas_s3` datasource wiring — connect, list containers, list files
- [ ] ⬜ File asset config model: container, batching regex, file format (CSV / Parquet / JSON)

### Unity Catalog / Databricks (3 tasks — 2/3)
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for Databricks connection — `UnityCatalogConnectionAdapter` (workspace URL + warehouse id + PAT; `SELECT 1` `test` via `databricks-sql-connector`), one-line registry add. PAT-only (secret-bearing, no `secret_ref`-nullability deferral). The `UnityCatalogCheckRunner` (DQX swap-in, CLAUDE.md §5) is the Week-3 run path, not built here
- [ ] ⬜ GX Spark / JDBC datasource wiring for Unity Catalog — connect, list catalogs / schemas / tables
- [x] ✅ UC auth test endpoint — validate PAT + SQL Warehouse reachability — the `SELECT 1` probe in `UnityCatalogConnectionAdapter.test`, surfaced through the generic `POST /connections/{id}/test`

**Week 2 total: 15 / 19** _(ADF webhook receiver: endpoint+auth, payload parse, secret config, REST `fetch_run_detail` enrichment; upsert+correlate 🟡 — trigger-on-success skeleton landed, run_suite dispatch gated to Week 3; polling → Week 5. **Airflow group complete (3/3)** — HMAC receiver + connection adapter + DAG callback snippet, so the producer↔receiver loop is closed end-to-end. All six connection types now have adapters: Snowflake + ADF + Airflow + ADLS Gen2 + S3 + Unity Catalog. Remaining W2 tail: connection re-auth endpoint + `secret_ref` nullability note; the rest are Week-3/5 GX run-path tasks)_

---

## Week 3 — Suite & check API — all datasource types (backend)

**Exit gate:** Full check CRUD API across Snowflake, flat files and Unity Catalog; column profiler live.

### Suite & check backend (4 tasks — 4/4 ✅)
- [x] ✅ API: CRUD for suites and GX expectations (Snowflake path) — **suites** (PR-B1): `suite_service` + `/suites` CRUD (`connection_id` validated then immutable; delete cascades to checks). **checks** (PR-B2): `check_service` + nested `/suites/{id}/checks` CRUD surfacing `kind` + `warn/fail/critical_threshold` + GX `expectation_type`/`config`. v1 monitor-kind guard (only `expectation`; reserved kinds → 422, ADR 0012); checks scoped to their suite (cross-suite access → 404); thresholds are `Decimal` in (exact `Numeric` storage) / `float` out (clean JSON). 24 TestClient tests; all four modules 100%. Share-based access filtering deferred to the suite-sharing task; **DQ-dimension classification** deferred + tracked ([#124](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/124))
- [x] ✅ API: suite sharing — assign users with owner / editor / viewer roles — **sharing API + authz core** (PR-E1): `suite_authz.require_permission` (404-hides a suite with no access, 403s an insufficient level) + `share_service` + `/suites/{id}/shares` CRUD. Schema vocab `view`/`edit`/`admin` + implicit owner=`created_by`; **admin can delete + manage shares** (per decision); grant-to-owner/unknown → 422; manage needs `admin`, list needs `view`. **Enforcement** (PR-E2): `require_permission` applied across the suite endpoints (GET=view, PATCH=edit, DELETE=admin) + all check endpoints (reads=view, writes=edit); `list_suites` scoped to owned-or-shared. Lands the access control deferred in B1/B2. ~26 TestClient tests across the matrix acting as different users (viewer reads-not-writes, editor writes-not-deletes, admin deletes, outsider→404, list scoping); shares/suites/checks routes + share_service all 100%
- [x] ✅ API: suite export to JSON + import from JSON — `suite_io_service` + `GET /suites/{id}/export` (view) / `POST /suites/import` (any authed user, like create). Document is **connection-agnostic** — omits all DB identity (`id`/`connection_id`/`created_by`/timestamps), so it's a reusable template; import **re-binds** to a freshly chosen `connection_id` and owns the new suite as the importer. Round-trippable: thresholds are `Decimal` in/out (exact). Import is **atomic** — every check kind is validated before any row is written (bad doc → 422, nothing persisted); unknown `version` → 422; missing connection → 422. Checks emitted in stable creation order (diffable). Reuses `check_service.validate_kind` (no dup). 7 TestClient tests (no-identity-leak, view-gated, owned-by-importer, export→import→export round-trip, unknown-connection/version/kind-atomic); `suite_io_service` + `suites.py` 100%
- [x] ✅ API: check dry-run endpoint — validate against live data, return preview result — `POST /suites/{id}/checks/dryrun` (`dryrun_service`): runs **one ad-hoc check** against the suite's connection synchronously and returns a preview (severity `status` + `metric_value` + sanitized `observed/expected`) **without persisting** any Run/Result. Reuses the severity derivation (ADR 0005/0016) + JSON sanitiser. `require_permission` **edit** (authoring); table passed in the body (checks don't carry a target table yet). v1 → 422: non-`expectation` kind, non-Snowflake connection (runner dispatch generalises Week 5); execution failure → 502 (adapter exception never echoed). No `sample_failures` in the preview (PII; follow-up). 7 TestClient tests (mocked runner); `dryrun_service` + `checks.py` 100%

### Severity threshold tiers (warn / fail / critical) (4 tasks — 4/4)
> **Day 1 design decision: severity weights — ✅ settled in [ADR 0005](adr/0005-severity-tier-weights.md) (warn 0.5 / fail 1.0 / critical 2.0; health = 100×(1−Σpenalty/(N×2.0))).**
- [x] ✅ Add `warn_threshold`, `fail_threshold`, `critical_threshold` fields to check model — nullable `Numeric` columns on `Check` (NULL → plain pass/fail) — migration `9c59b6a44f33`
- [x] ✅ Alembic migration — threshold columns + `status` enum (`pass`, `warn`, `fail`, `critical`) **+ the monitor-kind / metric columns below (one migration)** — the one-shot Week-3 schema seam `9c59b6a44f33` (tested up→down→up; `results.status` retargeted from `passed/failed/skipped` with a data-update-before-CHECK-swap; `run_service` now writes `pass`/`fail` binary-fallback per ADR 0005). `alembic check` clean (no model drift)
- [x] ✅ Post-processing in GX result handler — derive `warn` / `fail` / `critical` from observed value (PR-C) — `services/severity.py` (`extract_metric` + `derive_status`), wired into `run_service._build_result`. Thresholds band the GX **unexpected-%** as `metric_value` (higher=worse, ordered, unset-tier skipped); thresholds-as-policy override GX `success`; binary fallback when no thresholds / no metric. **Settled in [ADR 0016](adr/0016-severity-derivation-semantics.md)** (incl. A→B reversibility: raw `observed_value` retained → switch is additive `direction` column + backfill, never destructive). `duration_ms` stays NULL (per-check timing not separable from GX's suite-level `validate()`). 16 unit + 1 integration test; both modules 100%
- [x] ✅ Update check CRUD + run result response schemas with threshold fields + status values — check-CRUD thresholds (PR-B2) + result response now carries `status` (`pass`/`warn`/`fail`/`critical`) + `metric_value` (probe `CheckResultResponse`, PR-C)

### Monitor abstraction & metric storage — do-now seams (3 tasks — 3/3)
> **Day 1 design decision: `check.kind` discriminator + numeric metric storage — ✅ settled in [ADR 0012](adr/0012-monitor-kind-seam.md); rides the same migration.** Keeps v1.x auto-monitors (freshness / volume / schema-drift / anomaly — post-v1 Theme A) from forcing a check/result schema rewrite. v1 implements `expectation` only.
- [x] ✅ Add `kind` discriminator to check model (`'expectation'` default; `freshness`/`volume`/`schema_drift`/`anomaly` reserved) — `checks.kind` `NOT NULL DEFAULT 'expectation'` + CHECK over the 6 reserved kinds (incl. `comparison`, ADR 0014) — migration `9c59b6a44f33`
- [x] ✅ Generalise run path to dispatch by `check.kind` (`expectation` → GX `CheckRunner`; others raise `NotImplementedError`) — PR-D: `run_service._specs_for_checks` dispatches by kind; a non-`expectation` check raises `NotImplementedError` → the run goes terminal `failed` **without invoking the adapter** (never silently run as a GX expectation). Composes with the Week-5 `connection.type` runner selection (`kind` picks the monitor, type picks the adapter). `run_service` 100%; test fixtures now set `kind` to mirror DB rows
- [x] ✅ Add `metric_value` (NUMERIC) + `duration_ms` (INT) to results — SQL-aggregatable metric for Week-6 trends + v1.1 anomaly; per-check runtime for cost surface — nullable columns on `Result` — migration `9c59b6a44f33`

### Column profiler (3 tasks — 3/3 ✅)
- [x] ✅ Column profiler endpoint (Snowflake) — nulls, distinct count, min / max, top values — `profile_service` + `POST /suites/{id}/profile` (require_permission **edit**, suite-scoped so the connection is access-gated). Reads-only, persists nothing: one aggregate query (row count + null/distinct/min/max per column) + one top-N-values query per column, then `assemble_profile`. **SQL-injection-safe** — queries are built with the **SQLAlchemy Core expression language** (`select`/`table`/`column`, dialect-quoted) so there's no raw-string SQL sink (no S608/B608/CodeQL `py/sql-injection`); identifiers are additionally allowlist-validated (`validate_identifier`, strict `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_$]*$`) as defence-in-depth + a clean early 422, and `top_n` is `int()`-coerced. v1 → 422: non-Snowflake type (dispatch generalises Week 5), bad identifier, no schema; execution failure → 502 (adapter exception never echoed). min/max/top-values NaN-sanitised. 28 tests (22 pure: identifier allowlist incl. injection strings, compiled-SQL builders, assembly, div-by-zero, NaN; 6 endpoint via fake conn: stats, injection-422, unsupported-type-422, 502, edit-gated, no-schema-422); `suites.py` 100%, `profile_service` 90% (live `_open_connection` is the deferred warehouse seam)
- [x] ✅ Column profiler endpoint (ADLS / S3) — same stats via Pandas on sampled file — extended `profile_service` into a type dispatcher (`profile_connection`): SQL types → in-warehouse aggregation (unchanged), flat-file types (`adls_gen2`/`s3`) → download a **sample** of the file into Pandas and compute the same stats (`profile_dataframe`). Same `POST /suites/{id}/profile` endpoint, now polymorphic: SQL targets pass `table`/`schema`, flat-file targets pass `path` (+ optional `file_format`, else inferred from extension); response carries whichever identity applies. CSV + Parquet. **pandas "load less data" levers** (per the user's scale.html prompt): column projection (CSV `usecols`, Parquet `columns=` via pyarrow schema) so profiling 3 of N columns doesn't read all N, + row sampling (`_SAMPLE_ROWS`), + **zero-copy Arrow-backed dtypes** on the Parquet read (`dtype_backend="pyarrow"` — parquet is already Arrow, kept zero-copy; the stat helpers + `_to_native` are Arrow-scalar/`pd.NA`-safe). Stats are vectorised pandas (no Python row loops — enhancingperf N/A; CoW is a no-op for a read-only profiler + a process-global flag, so not toggled; pyarrow CSV engine rejected — it's incompatible with `nrows`/callable-`usecols`). NaN/Timestamp→JSON-safe. v1 → 422: unsupported type (UC still pending), missing target, unknown format, missing column; read failure → 502 (exception never echoed). Reuses `ColumnProfile`/`ProfileResult`. 24 new tests (pure `profile_dataframe`/`infer_file_format`/`_to_native`/projection-parse + endpoint via fake `_read_dataframe`); `suites.py` 100%, `profile_service` 85% (only the live `_open_connection`/`_download_bytes` network seams uncovered — deferred smoke). _Deferred: streaming/range reads (whole object still downloaded before sampling) + out-of-core (Dask) — future work if profiling cost bites._
- [x] ✅ Column profiler endpoint (Unity Catalog) — via Databricks SQL Warehouse — added `unity_catalog` to the profiler's **SQL** branch (reuses `profile_table` + the SQLAlchemy Core query builders + `assemble_profile` — no duplicate aggregation logic). `_open_connection` now dispatches the engine by type (`_engine_args`): Snowflake URL or a `databricks://token:…@host?http_path=…` URL via the installed `databricks` SQLAlchemy dialect. UC's **3-level namespace** (`catalog.schema.table`) is handled by building the table with a `quoted_name(f"{catalog}.{schema}", quote=False)` so the dialect emits three dotted parts rather than quoting the dotted string as one — verified by compiling the real builders against the Databricks dialect. Injection-safe: every part (catalog/schema/table/column) is allowlist-validated (no raw-string SQL, no CodeQL py/sql-injection surface). Endpoint gained `catalog` (request + response); the dispatcher requires it for UC (`422 profile_target_invalid` if absent). 12 new tests (catalog-aware builders compiled to SQL, `_engine_args` URL dispatch, UC endpoint stats via the same fake conn, missing-catalog 422, bad-catalog-identifier 422); `suites.py` 100%, `profile_service` 86% (only the live `_open_connection`/`_download_bytes` network seams uncovered — deferred smoke). **Completes the column profiler across all 4 datasources.**

### Flat file check specifics (2 tasks — 2/2 ✅)
- [x] ✅ Check types for flat files: schema validation, row count, null checks, ~~freshness by filename date~~ — `FlatFileCheckRunner` (`datasources/flatfile.py`): downloads the file (S3/ADLS) into a pandas DataFrame and runs the suite's GX expectations against GX's **pandas DataFrame asset**, so all GX expectation-kind checks (schema/row-count/null/value checks) run against flat files. Extracted the shared GX machinery — snake_case→GX-class translation, GX-result→`SuiteOutcome` mapping, and the suite/validation-definition `run_expectations` flow — into `datasources/gx_runner.py` (reused by the Snowflake runner and the future UC runner; no duplication). Flat-file IO (`download_bytes` + full-file `read_dataframe`) moved to `flatfile.py` behind primitives (raw config + resolved secret, not the ORM — matches `build_snowflake_runner`), and the column profiler now shares it. Because GX runs **in-process on the DataFrame**, the run path is fully unit-tested with a canned frame (real GX execution, not mocked) — only the network download is the deferred-smoke seam. 16 new tests; `gx_runner` 100%, `flatfile` 76% (only `download_bytes` uncovered). _Connection-type → runner dispatch (Snowflake vs flat-file) is the Week-5 `run_suite` wiring; **freshness-by-filename** is the reserved `freshness` monitor kind (deferred, ADR 0012), not a GX expectation._
- [x] ✅ Batch resolution — resolve batching regex to matched files, pick latest or specific batch — `resolve_batch` (`datasources/flatfile.py`): a batch `pattern` is a regex whose **first capture group is the batch key**; `latest` selects the greatest key (lexicographic — ISO dates sort chronologically), falling back to the storage modified-time when the pattern has no group; `specific` selects the file whose key equals a given `batch`. `BatchNotFoundError` on no match / unknown batch. The filter+select logic is pure and fully unit-tested (8 tests); object listing (`list_files` — S3 `list_objects_v2` paginated / ADLS `list_blobs`) is the live seam, and `resolve_batch_file` composes list+resolve. _Wiring a check's target to a resolved batch path is the Week-5 `run_suite` dispatch._

### Unity Catalog check specifics (2 tasks — 2/2 ✅)
- [x] ✅ UC table check path — UC table → GX DataFrame datasource → run suite — `UnityCatalogCheckRunner` (`datasources/unity_catalog.py`): reads the target table from the Databricks SQL Warehouse into a pandas DataFrame (`pd.read_sql_table` via the databricks SQLAlchemy dialect — reflection quotes identifiers, so no hand-built SQL) and runs the suite's GX expectations against GX's **pandas DataFrame asset** — the "GX DataFrame datasource" shape (§5), the same shape Databricks Labs DQX consumes, so v1.1 swaps GX→DQX behind this one interface. Reuses the shared `gx_runner` (`run_expectations` + result mapping) exactly like the flat-file runner; the `catalog` is pinned in the connection URL (`build_databricks_url`, now shared with the column profiler — no duplication) so the 2-level `schema.table` resolves to `catalog.schema.table`. Because GX runs **in-process on the DataFrame**, the run path is unit-tested with a canned frame (real GX execution); only the reflect+read (`_read_table`) is the deferred-smoke seam. `build_unity_catalog_runner` mirrors `build_snowflake_runner` (raw config + resolved PAT, not the ORM). 14 tests; `unity_catalog` 91% (only `_read_table` uncovered). _Connection-type → runner dispatch is the Week-5 `run_suite` wiring._
- [x] ✅ Integration tests across all three datasource types — `backend/tests/integration/test_datasource_runs.py`: end-to-end suite runs through the **real** `run_service.execute_run` + **real Postgres** persistence, with **real GX execution** for the flat-file (`FlatFileCheckRunner`) and Unity Catalog (`UnityCatalogCheckRunner`) paths on an in-memory DataFrame (only the file download / table read is stubbed) — exercising the whole chain: `check.kind` dispatch → runner → GX validation → severity derivation → `Result` rows. Snowflake runs through a canned outcome (live warehouse is the deferred-smoke seam; its GX mapping is covered in `datasources/test_snowflake.py`). Asserts run `succeeded`, both Results persisted, severity derived (null-check → `fail`, row-count → `pass` with observed value). Plus a parametrized **adversarial-frame** run (numpy + pyarrow hostile columns via the shared battery) proving a column-agnostic monitor still runs + persists over a file whose data column is hostile. 7 tests.

**Week 3 total: 18 / 18 ✅ — COMPLETE**

## Week 4 — Connection manager UI + check editor UI (frontend)

**Exit gate:** Users can configure any connection type and author checks end-to-end in the UI.

### Frontend tooling coordinated bumps (added — not in original roadmap) (1 task — 1/1)
- [x] ✅ Vite 8 coordinated bump — `vite` ^6→^8.0.16 + `@vitejs/plugin-react` ^5→^6.0.2 + `vitest` ^3→^4.1.8 + `@vitest/coverage-v8` ^4.1.8 in lockstep — [PR #119](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/119) (Fixes [#65](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/65); supersedes Dependabot #111 + closed [#57](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/57)). plugin-react v6 peers `vite ^8`, vitest v4 peers `vite ^6||^7||^8` — done early to drain the frontend dep backlog; format/lint/typecheck/test/build all green

### Frontend polish from PR-3c review (added — not in original roadmap) (3 tasks — 2/3 ✅, 1 🔵 blocked)
- [x] ✅ Wrap `MsalProvider` subtree in an antd `AntApp` / React error boundary so render-time failures don't fall back to plain text — `AntApp` already wrapped the tree; added a class `ErrorBoundary` (antd `Result` fallback + Reload) inside it covering everything after first paint — [PR #210](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/210)
- [x] ✅ Bundle code-splitting — `React.lazy` per route + Suspense + `manualChunks` vendor split (react / antd / msal / vendor) — initial `index` chunk ~1.1 MB → **6.7 kB**; pages load on navigation — [PR #210](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/210) _(the residual >500 KB chunk is antd itself, now isolated as one long-cache vendor)_
- [ ] 🔵 Tighten `Settings.model_config` `extra="ignore"` → `"forbid"` — **blocked** on the precondition (tracked in [#209](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/209)): `.env.example` mixes compose-only vars (`POSTGRES_USER/PASSWORD/DB`, consumed by the postgres container) with app vars, and Settings has no fields for them, so `forbid` would crash startup. Needs the compose-only ↔ app-only `.env` split first ([PR #39 nit](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/39))

### Connection manager UI (6 tasks — 6/6 ✅)
- [x] ✅ Connection cards — Snowflake (3 envs), ADF, ADLS/S3, Databricks sections with status badges — grouped-by-type cards with env tag + credential badge + Test action — [PR #191](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/191)
- [x] ✅ Add connection drawer — type-specific form fields per connection type — spec-driven `ConnectionTypeFields` from `CONNECTION_FORM_SPECS` (all six types; Snowflake password/key-pair auth toggle) — [PR #196](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/196) (+ Snowflake key-pair backend [PR #193](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/193))
- [x] ✅ Connection health page — bulk test, live status, re-auth surface — "Test all" header action tests every connection concurrently; each card shows a live health badge (testing / healthy / unreachable) and surfaces an inline **Re-authenticate** link on failure — [PR #208](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/208) _(folded into the connections list rather than a duplicate route)_
- [x] ✅ Connection re-auth UI — surface expired tokens, inline refresh action — `ReauthModal` (single-secret rotate+verify) + edit drawer + delete via the card actions menu — [PR #198](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/198)
- [x] ✅ ADLS/S3 connection form — account URL, SAS toggle — covered by the spec-driven drawer ([PR #196](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/196)) _(container browser + managed-identity/IAM-role modes deferred with the backend, ADR 0010/0011)_
- [x] ✅ Databricks connection form — workspace URL, PAT, warehouse id — covered by the spec-driven drawer ([PR #196](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/196)) _(live SQL-Warehouse picker deferred; warehouse id is a text field)_

### Check editor UI (9 tasks — 5/9 ✅, 2 🟡)
- [x] ✅ Suite list + detail two-panel layout, environment badge on each suite — selectable suites list ←→ detail (connection chip + env tag + checks) — [PR #200](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/200)
- [x] ✅ Form-based check editor — catalog-driven expectation picker + dynamic typed config fields + create/edit/delete — `expectationCatalog.ts` + `CheckDrawer` ([PR #203](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/203)). GX expectations are datasource-agnostic in v1, so one catalog serves all four types
- [ ] 🟡 Flat file check editor — container picker, batching regex input, file format selector — generic catalog editor covers flat-file expectations ([PR #203](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/203)); the batch/format/container-specific inputs are still pending
- [ ] 🟡 Unity Catalog check editor — catalog / schema / table three-level picker — generic catalog editor covers UC expectations ([PR #203](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/203)); the 3-level table picker is still pending
- [ ] ⬜ Monaco SQL editor for custom check (all datasource types, Snowflake keyword autocomplete)
- [x] ✅ Column profiler panel — inline in check editor, loads on table / file selection — `ColumnProfilePanel` (shared by the create page `CheckNew` + the edit drawer `CheckDrawer`): a collapsed-by-default panel that profiles one column of the suite's run target (#215) via `POST /suites/{id}/profile` (no persistence) and renders null count/fraction, distinct count, min/max, and top values — so the author can ground a range / allowed-set / null threshold in real data before saving. The profiled column **pre-fills from the check's `column` config field** (render-phase prop-sync, like `DryRunPreview`) but stays editable to explore neighbouring columns; `table`/`schema`/`catalog` (SQL) or `path`/`file_format` (flat file) are pulled from the suite target. Disabled with a reason until the suite has a table/file target + a column is entered; backend limits (no credential / unreachable / unsupported type) surface as a clean error alert. 4 vitest (disabled-states / pre-filled-profile with request-shape assertion / error). _(PR-D2; `ColumnProfilePanel.tsx` + `api/suites.ts` `profileColumns`)_
- [x] ✅ **Check dry-run button** — preview pass/fail inline before saving — `DryRunPreview` component (shared by the create page `CheckNew` + the edit drawer `CheckDrawer`): runs the in-progress check against the suite's live target via `POST /suites/{id}/checks/dryrun` and renders the severity outcome (status tag + `metric_value` + observed/expected), **no persistence**. Reuses `buildCheckPayload` (so the preview runs exactly the saved check's config/thresholds) + the severity colour map; `table`/`schema` come from the suite's run target (#215, fetched via new `getSuite`). Disabled with a reason until an expectation is picked + the suite has a table target; backend limits (Snowflake-only, no-credential/unreachable) surface as a clean error alert (dev fail-softs to a 502 with fake creds). 4 vitest (disabled-states / success-outcome with request-shape assertion / error) + an e2e button-enabled assertion. _(PR-D1; `DryRunPreview.tsx` + `api/suites.ts` `getSuite`/`dryRunCheck`)_
- [ ] ⬜ Check version history drawer — see previous config before overwriting
- [x] ✅ Severity tier toggle in check editor — three-threshold UI — optional warn/fail/critical inputs banding the unexpected-% (ADR 0016), blank = binary — [PR #203](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/203)

### Access & admin UI (3 tasks — 1/3)
- [ ] ⬜ Suite sharing panel — add / remove users, assign roles inline _(backend sharing API ready from Week 3; **user-directory backend now landed** (PR-E2): `GET /users/search` (case-insensitive email/display_name substring, 2-char min, limit≤50, LIKE-escaped) behind a FastAPI-free `user_service`, + `ShareRead` enriched with the grantee's `email`/`display_name` via a joined read-only `Share.user` relationship — so the panel can pick collaborators by name and name who a suite is shared with; **PR-E3** builds the panel itself)_
- [ ] ⬜ Admin page — list all suites, all users, access overview
- [x] ✅ Suite export / import UI (download JSON, upload JSON) — **Export** button on the suite detail header downloads `<suite>.json` from `GET /suites/{id}/export` via a transient-anchor blob (`utils/download.ts` — `downloadJson` + `toFilenameStem`); **Import** button on the suites header opens `ImportSuiteDrawer` — drag/drop a `.json`, client-side parse + shape-check (fail-fast on non-suite/malformed JSON), pick a target connection, `POST /suites/import`. The parsed document is handed back **untouched** so thresholds round-trip exactly (string-or-number Decimal encoding never coerced). 11 tests (download lib: stem slug + blob/anchor/revoke; drawer: valid→import-with-faithful-document, non-suite/malformed-JSON rejection, connection-gated Import). _(PR-E1; backend ready from Week 3)_

### GX-Cloud-style UI redesign (added — not in original roadmap) (4 tasks — 4/4 ✅)
> Model the UI on [GX Cloud](https://greatexpectations.io/gx-cloud/): dedicated **full-page create flows** that **classify** what you're creating, keeping the lighter drawers for *edit*. Plan: `~/.claude/plans/fancy-moseying-raccoon.md`. Decided: in-app results page (Grafana deferred to an optional post-v1 ops add-on, never the per-suite authz path — ADR 0018 pending); full-page create + drawer edit; connections/checks redesign now (backends ready), results after the Week-5 run-enablement backend.
- [x] ✅ **Connections — dedicated, classified add page** — `/connections/new` splits the type picker into **Data sources** vs **Orchestration** sections (CLAUDE.md §4), then the spec-driven form; the list page is grouped the same way. `CONNECTION_KIND` is the single source for the split. Edit/re-auth/delete stay on the drawer. _(PR-A1; `ConnectionNew.tsx` + sectioned `Connections.tsx`)_
- [x] ✅ **Connections — `ConnectionDrawer` trimmed to edit-only** — create now lives on the page; the drawer drops the type/env Selects + secret + create branch, shows type/env read-only, and the list owns a simpler `editing: Connection | null` state. _(PR-A2)_
- [x] ✅ **Checks — suite selection as a route + categorized expectation picker** — `/suites/:suiteId` makes the selected suite deep-linkable and survives the check-editor round-trip; the catalog gains a `category` (Column values / Table shape) and the picker groups by it (antd optgroups). Reserved Freshness/Volume/Schema-drift categories (ADR 0012) land with the dedicated page. _(PR-B1)_
- [x] ✅ **Checks — dedicated `/suites/:suiteId/checks/new` page** — category → expectation → config/thresholds, with reserved monitor-kind categories (Freshness/Volume/Schema-drift, ADR 0012) shown disabled. Shared form logic extracted to `checkForm.ts` (conversions) + `checkFormFields.tsx` (field components), reused by the page and the now edit-only `CheckDrawer`. The natural home for the [#215](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/215) target table/path field. _(PR-B2; `CheckNew.tsx`)_

**Week 4 total: 19 / 26 ✅ (+2 🟡, 1 🔵)** _(connection manager UI complete (6/6); check editor core shipped + **dry-run preview** (PR-D1) + **column profiler panel** (PR-D2); **suite export/import UI** (PR-E1); **GX-Cloud redesign complete (4/4)** — classified connection + check create pages, edit-only drawers, suite-route/categorized picker (PR-A1/A2/B1/B2); PR-3c polish 2/3 (Settings `forbid` 🔵 blocked on the `.env` split) — sharing/admin UI (backend unblocked by PR-E2 user-search + enriched `ShareRead`; PR-E3 builds the panel) + Monaco custom-SQL remain)_

---

## Week 5 — Execution engine + scheduling

**Exit gate:** Async runs with live progress across all datasource types; scheduling operational.

### Async execution backend (9 tasks — 4/9 ✅, early)
- [x] ✅ Celery + Redis background task runner for GX scan execution — `run_suite` task + `run_service` — landed early via [PR 4a](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/74) + [PR 4c-i](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/78) + [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79)
- [x] ✅ Generalise `run_suite` worker dispatch — select the `CheckRunner` by `connection.type` via the runner registry (`build_check_runner`), replacing the Snowflake-hardcoded wiring in `worker/tasks.py`; the seam that makes the flat-file / UC run paths route correctly and post-v1 RDBMS adapters a drop-in — [PR #146-fix](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/146) _(added per [ADR 0011](adr/0011-extensibility-seams-for-deferred-integrations.md); profiler dispatch collapsed onto a parallel registry in the same effort, [#147](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/147))_
- [x] ✅ **Check target table/path** — modeled as a **per-suite** datasource-shaped `Suite.target` (JSONB, shaped like the column-profiler request: `table`/`schema`/`catalog`/`path`/`file_format`), since `execute_run` runs all of a suite's checks against one batch (the GX data-asset-per-suite shape). `services/run_target.resolve_target` resolves it per connection type to the runner's `(table, schema, catalog)` triple (flat-file path rides the table-shaped `CheckRunner`'s `table` slot); `validate_target` is the write-time 422 guard on suite create/update. Migration `b1f2c3d4e5a6` (additive nullable column, tested up/down on Postgres). **Dispatch ungated**: `_trigger_suites` now hands each created run to `run_suite.delay` (lazy import — worker↔service cycle), broker-fail marks the run `failed`; `run_suite` resolves the target from the suite (targetless → clean `failed`), so the worker no longer takes a `table` arg; stale `until_week3` wording removed. 13 resolver units + worker/orchestration/suite-API target tests. _(Re-tracked from Week 3; [#215](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/215); PR-C0a)_
- [x] ✅ **Manual run trigger + run/result read API** — `POST /suites/{id}/run` queues a `Run` and dispatches it via the shared `run_dispatch.dispatch_run` helper (**edit**-gated — the capability ladder grants "trigger runs" at edit); the suite target (#215) is resolved **up front** so a targetless/misconfigured suite fails fast with 422 instead of a queued→failed run, and a broker outage marks the run `failed` + returns 503 (same contract as the probe). New `api/v1/runs.py` read surface for the results page: `GET /runs?suite_id=&status=&limit=` and `GET /runs/{id}` (run + joined `Result`s) are **suite-scoped** — the list filters to accessible suites and the detail gates on `require_permission(view)`, so per-suite sharing + existence-hiding hold (exactly why direct-Postgres/Grafana is rejected as the primary surface); `GET /pipeline_runs?provider=&status=` is the orchestration monitoring feed (auth-only, not suite-scoped). Read helpers live in `run_service.list_runs/get_run/list_results` + `orchestration_service.list_pipeline_runs`. 14 DB-backed API tests (trigger happy/targetless-422/edit-403/no-access-404/broker-503; list scoping+filters+limit; detail+results / 404s; pipeline filters + auth). _(Run-enablement gap; PR-C0b; gates the Week-6 Results page PR-C1)_
- [ ] ⬜ Run progress API — poll endpoint returning per-check live status
- [ ] ⬜ Cancel run endpoint — gracefully terminate in-progress Celery task
- [ ] ⬜ Run history retention policy — configurable purge of results older than N days
- [ ] ⬜ Flat file run path — resolve batch, load via Pandas, execute GX suite
- [ ] ⬜ UC run path — submit job to Databricks SQL Warehouse, execute GX suite

### ADF + Airflow hybrid monitoring (webhook + polling fallback) (4 tasks — 2/4 ✅)
- [x] ✅ Celery beat task — poll ADF REST API every 10 min for **succeeded** runs (skip pipelines updated by webhook recently) — provider-agnostic `poll_orchestration_runs` beat task through the `OrchestrationProvider` seam — [PR #171](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/189)
- [x] ✅ Celery beat task — poll Airflow REST API `dagRuns` every 10 min — same provider-agnostic beat task (ADF + Airflow share it) — [PR #171](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/189) _(added per ADR 0004; not in roadmap)_
- [ ] ⬜ Gap recovery logic — on startup + every 30 min, fetch last hour of run statuses
- [ ] ⬜ `GET /api/v1/orchestration/pipelines` — latest status per pipeline/DAG, provider-agnostic

> **`trigger_bindings` CRUD** (provider-agnostic suite-run triggers — `provider`/`pipeline_or_dag_id`/`env` → `suite_id`) landed early via [PR #172](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/190), unblocking the trigger-on-success path skeletoned in Week 2 PR 8.

### Execution UI (5 tasks — 0/5)
- [ ] ⬜ Run now panel — suite picker, env / datasource, notification target
- [ ] ⬜ Live run progress UI — check-by-check status with spinner + cancel button
- [ ] ⬜ Scheduled runs table — create, pause, delete cron schedules
- [ ] ⬜ Recent runs audit table with drill-down link to results
- [ ] ⬜ **Suite Triggers panel** — UI over the existing `trigger_bindings` CRUD (#172): bind/unbind a pipeline/DAG (`provider` + `pipeline_or_dag_id` + `env`) to a suite so it runs on the pipeline's success. **Suite-level**, not a check field (orchestration providers are never a datasource/check attribute, CLAUDE.md §4); lives on the suite detail. Backend done; UI pending — [#216](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/216)

**Week 5 total: 6 / 18** _(early credit: Celery task runner in PR 4; worker runner-dispatch #146; ADF + Airflow 10-min polling #171; plus `trigger_bindings` CRUD #172 out-of-band; check target-table + dispatch ungate #215 (PR-C0a); manual run trigger + run/result read API (PR-C0b). +3 tasks re-tracked here: check target-table #215 (slipped from W3), Suite Triggers UI #216, and the run-enablement read API (PR-C0b))_

## Week 6 — Results dashboard + alerting

**Exit gate:** Full results dashboard live across all source types; alerts firing with suppression.

### Results dashboard (10 tasks — 1/10 ✅, + PR-C1 scaffold)
> **Build as an in-app React page** (the GX-Cloud-style redesign Phase C), **not Grafana** — reading Postgres directly would bypass DataQ's per-suite sharing + PII redaction; Grafana is deferred to an optional post-v1 ops add-on ([ADR 0018](adr/0018-results-surface-and-grafana-deferral.md), accepted). The Week-5 run-enablement backend it gates on is **done**: `runs.py` read endpoints (`GET /runs`, `GET /runs/{id}`, `GET /pipeline_runs`) + `POST /suites/{id}/run` (PR-C0b); [#215](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/215) target (PR-C0a). The `results.metric_value`/`duration_ms` columns were seam-built for these trend charts (ADR 0012).
- [x] ✅ **Results page scaffold** (PR-C1) — the in-app `/results` page + sidebar nav (Connections · Suites · **Results** · Profile). **Runs tab**: a runs table (suite name, status, triggered-by, started, duration) with a status filter, each row opening a **run-detail drawer** that drills into the per-check results (check name + expectation, severity tag, `metric_value`, observed value). **Pipeline runs tab**: the orchestration monitoring feed (`pipeline_runs`) with a provider filter. Pure presentation helpers (`resultsFormat.ts` — duration/timestamp formatters, status→colour maps) are unit-tested; `api/runs.ts` mirrors the C0b schemas. Demo seed (`demo_data.py`) now lands runs + results (pass/pass/warn/fail spread) + two pipeline-runs + suite targets so the page has real content. 10 vitest + 2 Playwright (`results.spec.ts`). _The rich widgets below build on this scaffold._
- [ ] ⬜ Health score stat cards + 7-day trend chart
- [ ] ⬜ Per-suite pass / fail progress bars — warn / fail / critical breakdown
- [ ] 🟡 Results filter bar — env, datasource type, suite, date range, status — _run **status** filter + pipeline **provider** filter shipped (PR-C1); env/datasource/suite/date-range pending_
- [ ] 🟡 Failed check drill-down — sample failing rows from GX result — _per-check drill-down shipped (PR-C1); **sample rows withheld** pending row-level PII redaction ([#226](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/226), ADR 0018)_
- [ ] ⬜ Per-check historical trend chart
- [ ] 🟡 Orchestration status panel — pipeline/DAG status, polls every 30s, correlated DQ result — _pipeline-runs feed + status shipped (PR-C1, `/pipeline_runs` tab); 30s auto-poll + DQ-run correlation pending_
- [ ] ⬜ Datasource type filter — Snowflake / flat file / Unity Catalog toggle
- [ ] ⬜ CSV + PDF export of results
- [x] ✅ Severity badge colours — green / amber / red / dark red — severity-tier (pass/warn/fail/critical) + run-status tag colour maps in `resultsFormat.ts`, rendered as antd Tags on the runs table + run detail (PR-C1)
- [ ] ⬜ Health score weighting — apply warn/fail/critical penalty weights

### Alerting (6 tasks — 0/6)
- [ ] ⬜ `ResultPublisher` seam — dispatch run outcomes from the post-`execute_run` completion point through a small publisher interface (Teams is the v1 implementation, not a hardcoded call); carry a PII redaction / opt-in policy on `sample_failures` at the seam since it leaves DataQ's trust boundary. Enables post-v1 TestRail / JIRA / Xray publishers as additional subscribers with no re-plumbing _(added per [ADR 0011](adr/0011-extensibility-seams-for-deferred-integrations.md))_
- [ ] ⬜ Notification config UI — Teams webhook per suite, alert on fail / warn / always
- [ ] ⬜ Alert suppression / snooze — silence a specific check for N hours
- [ ] ⬜ Alert dedup — fire on first failure only, not on every subsequent scheduled run
- [ ] ⬜ Teams adaptive card payload — check, datasource, table / file, observed vs expected
- [ ] ⬜ Severity-aware alert routing — warn quiet, fail standard, critical @channel

**Week 6 total: 2 / 16** _(early credit: Results page scaffold + severity badge colours (PR-C1, the GX-Cloud redesign Phase C); 3 dashboard tasks partially landed — status/provider filters, per-check drill-down, pipeline-runs feed)_

## Week 7 — Deployment, hardening & docs

**Exit gate:** Production-ready v1 deployed to Azure, CI/CD live, team onboarded.

### DevOps & deployment (5 tasks — 0/5, 1 partial early)
- [ ] 🟡 Containerise FastAPI + React + Celery + Redis — backend `Dockerfile` + `api`/`worker` compose services landed early ([PR 4a](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/74)); React image + ACR/ACA still pending
- [ ] ⬜ Push images to Azure Container Registry
- [ ] ⬜ Deploy to Azure Container Apps (API + Celery worker) + Azure Static Web App (React UI) — wire CORS middleware for Static-Web-App → Container-Apps cross-origin ([PR #40 nit](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/40)); override hardcoded `dataq:dataq` Postgres creds + all secrets via Container Apps secret refs ([PR #39 nit](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/39))
- [ ] ⬜ CI/CD pipeline — lint, test, build, deploy on merge to `main`
- [ ] ⬜ Application Insights integration — traces, errors, slow queries, Celery task metrics _(keep the export behind the structlog handler seam in `core/logging.py`; if a vendor-neutral path is wanted, route via OpenTelemetry/OTLP so the backend is swappable — per [ADR 0010](adr/0010-provider-agnostic-infrastructure-seams.md). App Insights stays the only v1 backend; do not abstract speculatively)_
- [ ] ⬜ Real-vault integration test for `AzureKeyVaultStore` lazy-import branch (currently 0% coverage) ([PR #56 nit](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/56))

### Azure Monitor webhook setup (post-deployment) (5 tasks — 0/5)
- [ ] ⬜ Action Group (pre-prod) — webhook to pre-prod API URL, shared secret from Key Vault
- [ ] ⬜ Alert Rule (pre-prod) — `example-adf-preprod` factory, Failed pipeline runs signal
- [ ] ⬜ Action Group (prod) — same config pointing to prod API URL
- [ ] ⬜ Alert Rule (prod) — `example-adf-prod` factory, same signal + dimension config
- [ ] ⬜ Smoke test — deliberate DEV pipeline failure → webhook → DB update → UI within 5 min

### FastMCP — MCP server (12 tasks — 0/12)
- [ ] ⬜ Install FastMCP, scaffold `mcp_server.py`, mount at `/mcp`
- [ ] ⬜ Wire Azure AD token validation into FastMCP's auth provider
- [ ] ⬜ Resource: `list_suites`
- [ ] ⬜ Resource: `get_suite_results`
- [ ] ⬜ Resource: `get_health_score`
- [ ] ⬜ Resource: `get_adf_pipeline_status`
- [ ] ⬜ Tool: `trigger_suite_run`
- [ ] ⬜ Tool: `get_run_status`
- [ ] ⬜ Tool: `create_check`
- [ ] ⬜ Tool: `profile_column`
- [ ] ⬜ LLM-optimised docstrings for all 8 tools
- [ ] ⬜ E2E test with Claude Desktop — 4 canonical natural-language queries

### Hardening & docs (5 tasks — 0/5 + 1 🟡)
- [ ] 🟡 E2E test coverage for critical paths — full-stack E2E landed early ([#128](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/128)): API smoke (`backend/scripts/e2e_smoke.py`, 12/12) + browser smoke (`frontend/e2e/`, Playwright, 6/6, CI `frontend-e2e` job) cover auth/dev-bypass + the read + authoring paths. **Live run paths (Snowflake/flat-file/UC) still pending the W5 execution path + #215.**
- [ ] ⬜ Error handling audit — consistent error shapes across all endpoints
- [ ] ⬜ Ensure all FastAPI endpoints have `summary`, `description`, `tags`, `response_model`
- [ ] ⬜ README + deployment guide + env-var reference
- [ ] ⬜ Team onboarding session + feedback collection
- [ ] ⬜ Document MCP connection config (Claude Desktop / Claude.ai / Copilot / Cursor) in README

**Week 7 total: 0 / 29**

## Week 8 — Unit testing

**Exit gate:** ≥80% coverage gate enforced in CI across backend, API, frontend.

### Backend unit tests (pytest) (11 tasks — 0.5/11)
- [ ] ⬜ Auth service — token validation, session expiry, Key Vault credential retrieval
- [ ] 🟡 Connection service — CRUD operations, test endpoint logic per datasource type — Snowflake path covered (16 DB-backed tests, `connection_service.py` 100%) — [PR 5](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/85); ADF path + `(type, env)` orchestrator-guard covered (3 service tests, `adf.py` 100%) — PR 6; ADLS/S3/UC paths pending their CRUD PRs
- [ ] ⬜ Suite service — CRUD, share assignment, export / import serialisation
- [ ] ⬜ Check service — expectation builder, SQL validator, dry-run logic, threshold tier evaluation
- [ ] ⬜ Column profiler service — null count, distinct count, min/max per datasource type
- [ ] 🟡 Execution service — `run_suite` dispatch + `run_service.execute_run` + GX adapter + NaN sanitizer tested early ([PR 4b.1](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/77) + [PR 4c-i](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/78) + [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79)); progress polling / cancel / retention purge pending
- [ ] ⬜ Alerting service — Teams webhook dispatch, dedup logic, snooze / suppression
- [ ] 🟡 ADF service — parse + upsert + `fetch_run_detail` + enrichment + trigger-on-success covered (`AdfProvider` parse/fetch unit tests incl. ARM mapping/http-error; `orchestration_service` DB tests incl. replay idempotency, enrichment fail-soft, trigger gating — modules 100%) — PR 7 + PR 8; `list_recent_runs` polling + gap-recovery dedup pending Week 5
- [ ] ⬜ ADF polling service — succeeded run fetch, skip-if-recently-updated, gap recovery
- [ ] ⬜ Result service — health score calc, historical trend aggregation, export generation
- [ ] ⬜ MCP service — each of 8 tools returns correct shape; auth rejection; `trigger_suite_run` returns valid run_id
- [x] 🟡 **Secret service** — 12 tests, 88% coverage — [PR 3b](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/56) _(landed early)_

### API layer tests (pytest + httpx) (6 tasks — 0/6, probe endpoint covered early)
- [ ] ⬜ Auth endpoints — login redirect, token refresh, unauthorised → 401
- [x] ✅ **Probe endpoints** (out-of-roadmap) — POST creates+dispatches, idempotent seed, GET results, 404 — against real Postgres — [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79)
- [x] 🟡 Connection endpoints — CRUD happy paths + validation errors — Snowflake covered (13 TestClient tests: CRUD, 422/404/502, secret-never-leaks, auth gate) — [PR 5](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/85); ADF covered (4 TestClient tests: create, orchestrator 409, second-env 201, type filter) — PR 6; ADLS/S3/UC types follow their CRUD PRs
- [ ] ⬜ Suite & check endpoints — CRUD, share, export / import, dry-run
- [ ] ⬜ Execution endpoints — trigger run, poll progress, cancel, list history
- [ ] ⬜ Results endpoints — dashboard data, drill-down, filters, download
- [x] 🟡 ADF webhook endpoint — valid payload → 200 (recorded/ignored), missing+wrong token → 401, malformed/non-JSON → 422, secret-unconfigured → 503 (9 TestClient tests) — PR 7; duplicate-runId idempotency asserted at the service layer

### Frontend unit tests (Vitest + RTL) (6 tasks — 1/6)
- [x] ✅ **AuthGate** — 4 tests (dev_bypass renders children, unconfigured banner, real+unauth sign-in button, real+auth renders children) — [PR 3c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/63)
- [x] 🟡 **API client interceptor** — 3 tests (no-token in dev, Bearer in real-with-account, no-token in real-without-account) — [PR 3c](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/63)
- [ ] ⬜ Login screen — Azure AD button renders, redirects on click
- [ ] ⬜ Connection manager — card per type, status badge colours, re-auth flow
- [ ] ⬜ Check editor — form fields per check type, profiler loads, dry-run, severity tier toggle
- [ ] ⬜ Suite sharing panel — add/remove user, role assignment
- [ ] ⬜ Execution page — run now, progress bar updates, cancel button
- [ ] ⬜ Results dashboard — stat cards, filters, ADF panel, severity badges

### Test infrastructure (3 tasks — 0.5/3 🟡 early)
- [ ] 🟡 Pytest fixtures — transactional Postgres `db_session` fixture + CI postgres service + fake `CheckRunner`/session landed ([PR 4b.1](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/77) + [PR 4c-ii](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/pull/79)); mock GX context + mock webhooks pending
- [ ] ⬜ CI gate — PRs blocked if coverage drops below 80% _(coverage currently ~91%; `--cov-fail-under` still 0 until W8)_
- [ ] 🟡 Test data fixtures — sample suites, check results, run histories — `backend/scripts/demo_data.py` seeds a representative dataset (all six connection types + 3 suites with varied checks + a cross-user share) through the real service layer, wired into `seed_dev`; **run histories still pending** (need the W5 execution path). Paired with `backend/scripts/e2e_smoke.py` (full-stack API E2E — see below)

**Week 8 total: ~4 / 26 (early credit from per-slice tests in W1 — overall coverage ~91% backend; frontend ~80% lines)**

> **Full-stack E2E ([#128](https://github.com/TheurgicDuke771/DataQ/issues/128) — both halves landed):**
> - **API half** — `backend/scripts/e2e_smoke.py` drives the **real** running stack (docker compose + dev-bypass + the demo seed) with no mocks: asserts the six connection types list (secrets never returned), suites + checks read back, severity thresholds round-trip, the create→add-check→dry-run→delete authoring loop, and dry-run failing soft (502/422, not a crash). **12/12 pass.**
> - **Browser half** — `frontend/e2e/` (Playwright) drives the **React UI** the same way a user does (`browser → Vite proxy → api → Postgres`): app-shell loads under dev-bypass, sider nav, seeded connections grouped by type + "Test all" health path, seeded suite → its checks, and a full create-suite → add → delete authoring round-trip. **6/6 pass.** Wired into CI as the `frontend-e2e` job (Postgres + Redis services, migrate + seed, uvicorn on :8000, Playwright starts its own Vite server). See [frontend/e2e/README.md](../frontend/e2e/README.md).
>
> Live datasource `test()`/runs remain the deferred smoke (no real creds — connectivity fails-soft).

## How to update this file

When merging a PR:

1. Find the task(s) it implements in the relevant week.
2. Flip `⬜` → `✅` (or `⬜` → `🟡` if partial).
3. Append the PR link: `— [PR #N](https://github.com/.../pull/N)`.
4. Update the per-week subtotal at the bottom of the week.
5. Update the **Snapshot** table at the top (task count, open PRs/issues) and the **Aggregate** table.
6. If the PR added an out-of-roadmap task (e.g. ADR-driven scope change), add a row with the note.

PR-template checkbox enforces this. If the change is purely tooling / docs that doesn't map to a roadmap task, tick the "N/A" checkbox.
