## 1. Project summary

**DataQ** is the v1 evolution of SnowQ — a single-tenant data quality monitoring platform built around Great Expectations (GX Core). It runs DQ checks across **4 datasources** and integrates with **2 orchestration providers**.

| Layer | Components |
|---|---|
| **Datasources (you can write checks against)** | Snowflake (DEV/QA/UAT), ADLS Gen2, AWS S3, Unity Catalog (Databricks) |
| **Orchestration providers (monitor + trigger only — NOT datasources)** | Azure Data Factory (ADF), Apache Airflow |
| **Backend** | FastAPI + Celery + Redis + PostgreSQL + Alembic |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + Ant Design + Monaco editor |
| **Auth / secrets** | Azure AD (MSAL) + Azure Key Vault |
| **Deploy** | Azure Container Apps + Azure Static Web App |
| **Observability** | Azure Application Insights + structlog |
| **AI integration** | FastMCP (8 curated tools mounted at `/mcp`) — Claude Desktop / Claude.ai / Copilot / Cursor |

Timeline: **8 weeks** to v1. Scope: single tenant, suite-level access sharing, Azure-hosted.

**Promotion to `apps/` + `packages/`:** only if a real shared package emerges (e.g., auto-generated OpenAPI client in Week 4–5). Default flat.

## 4. Datasources vs orchestration — critical distinction

**Datasources** are stores you write DQ checks against:
- Snowflake (DEV/QA/UAT)
- ADLS Gen2 (flat files)
- AWS S3 (flat files)
- Unity Catalog / Databricks

**Orchestration providers** are NOT datasources. They are workflow engines whose pipelines/DAGs we observe and react to. Their *only* three responsibilities in DataQ:

1. **Monitor** pipeline/DAG runs → stored in `pipeline_runs` table (separate from `runs` / `results`).
2. **Detect failure** in near-real-time via provider-specific event channels (webhook for both).
3. **Trigger suite execution on successful completion** via `trigger_bindings` (`provider`, `pipeline_or_dag_id`, `suite_id`, `env`). Failure events alert the user but do NOT trigger suite runs.

Both providers implement a single `OrchestrationProvider` interface — ADF is the reference implementation, Airflow is the second. **Never hardcode ADF-only logic; always go through the abstraction.**

| Provider | Event channel | Auth | Polling fallback |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADF | Azure Monitor alert → webhook | Shared secret header (Azure Monitor's only mode) | ADF REST API, 10 min |
| Airflow | DAG `on_*_callback` → webhook | HMAC-signed payload (signing key in Key Vault) | Airflow REST API `dagRuns`, 10 min |

Airflow callbacks require the user to add a snippet to their DAGs (we can't mutate them). Polling is the documented fallback.

**Anti-pattern (do not do this):** treating ADF/Airflow as a 5th/6th datasource in the connection editor, check editor, or suite model.

---

## 5. Framework choice — GX-only for v1

- **v1:** Great Expectations (GX Core) is the sole DQ framework across all 4 datasources. Unifies result schema, suite/check model, MCP tools, and the check editor. Every v1 check is a GX **expectation** (`check.kind = 'expectation'`).
- **v1.1:** Databricks Labs **DQX** will be added for DLT / streaming use cases (GX is batch-only and runs poorly on streaming). DQX will implement the same `UnityCatalogCheckRunner` interface introduced in Week 3 — UI exposes `engine: gx | dqx` toggle on UC suites.
- **Monitor-kind seam (do-now, Week 3):** not every monitor is a GX expectation. A `check.kind` discriminator (`expectation` in v1; `freshness | volume | schema_drift | anomaly | comparison` reserved) + numeric `metric_value` on results let v1.x auto-monitors slot in without a check/result schema rewrite. This seam is **orthogonal to the datasource seams** (`CheckRunner`, `ConnectionAdapter`): it varies by *monitor kind*, not datasource. See ADR `0012` (and `0014` for the reserved `comparison` / cross-dataset reconciliation kind) and post-v1 roadmap Theme A. Most real incidents are freshness/volume, not value-level — this is the leap from "GX runner" to DQ platform.
- **Implication for Week 3:** keep the UC adapter thin behind `UnityCatalogCheckRunner` (DQX swap-in), **and** add `check.kind` + `metric_value`/`duration_ms` in the *same* threshold migration so the monitor-kind impls don't ripple into the suite/check/result layer later.

## 6. Working agreements (rules above feature work)

Full list (30 rules across 8 categories) lives in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Highlights:

### Commit & change discipline
- **One functionality per commit** (where possible).
- **Manually test each committed change before starting the next functionality** (required until unit tests land in Week 8).
- **Defects → GitHub issue, never silent fixes.** Use `gh issue create`. The fixing PR must include `Fixes #N`.
- **From Week 8 onward, every new functionality ships with tests.**

### Git workflow
- **Trunk-based** with short-lived feature branches off `main`. No long-lived `develop`.
- Branch names: `feature/<desc>`, `fix/issue-<N>-<desc>`, `chore/<desc>`, `docs/<desc>`.
- `main` is protected: PR + passing CI + no force-push. (≥1 approving review is disabled during solo-dev phase; re-enable before onboarding a second contributor.)
- **Squash-merge only into `main`.**
- **Conventional commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`).

### CI/CD quality gates (block merge)
- Ruff (lint), Black `--check` (format), mypy (types), pytest (from W8), frontend lint/format/test.
- `gitleaks` secret scanning (pre-commit + CI).
- Bandit (Python SAST) + CodeQL.
- Dependabot for npm + pip + github-actions.

### Tooling (locked in Week 1, do not drift)
- **Python:** conda env (`conda create -n dataq python=3.11`) — *not* venv, *not* poetry.
- **Black** formatter (CI-enforced).
- **Ruff** lint, **mypy** types, **structlog** logging, **Pydantic Settings** config (12-factor).
- **Frontend:** Prettier + ESLint.

### Observability
- **Structured logging from Week 1.** structlog, JSON, `request_id` correlation propagated FastAPI → Celery → GX.
- **PII redaction at logger level** (failed-check sample rows may contain sensitive data).
- **App Insights exception tracking wired Week 1**, not Week 7.

### Database
- **Backward-compatible migrations only.** No `DROP COLUMN` + code change in same PR. Two-step deploys from W5 onward.
- Migration PR checklist: rollback plan + "tested up + down locally."

### Documentation
- **ADRs in `docs/adr/`** — one short markdown per significant decision.
- `scripts/setup.sh` — one command from clone to working dev env.

### Security cadence
- End-of-week quick scan from Week 2: vuln alerts, secret scan, OWASP spot check, Key Vault audit.
- Hard security review gate before Week 7 deploy.

## 7. Required reading before coding

1. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — full 30-rule working agreements + DoD + commit/branch conventions
2. [docs/adr/](docs/adr/) — all ADRs (architecture decisions with rationale)
3. [context/DataQ_platform_roadmap.md](context/DataQ_platform_roadmap.md) — the 8-week, 100-task product roadmap
4. The current week's milestone target (see §13 below)

---

## 8. Local dev quickstart

> **Note:** These commands assume Week 1 scaffolding (PR 1) is in place. They will not work on a fresh clone until `scripts/setup.sh`, `environment.yml`, and `docker-compose.yml` are committed.

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd DataQ
./scripts/setup.sh           # creates conda env, installs pre-commit, pulls images, runs migrations, seeds dev data
conda activate dataq
docker-compose up            # Postgres + Redis + FastAPI + React + Celery worker
# Smoke test:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/_probe/snowflake-suite
# Browse Swagger: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

| Repo layout: flat monorepo (`backend/` + `frontend/`) | [0009](docs/adr/0009-flat-monorepo-layout.md) | Locked W1 |
| Provider-agnostic infra seams (Azure = default impl, not architecture; auth boundary now, observability via OTel deferred) | [0010](docs/adr/0010-provider-agnostic-infrastructure-seams.md) | Accepted W2 |

| Monitor-kind seam (`check.kind` discriminator + numeric `metric_value`/`duration_ms`; v1 = `expectation` only, auto-monitors deferred to v1.x) | [0012](docs/adr/0012-monitor-kind-seam.md) | Accepted W2 (rides the W3 threshold migration) |
| Marketplace distribution = customer-deployed **BYOL** (not multi-tenant hosted SaaS); post-v1; standing anti-lock-in guardrails keep Azure as one impl behind each seam | [0013](docs/adr/0013-marketplace-distribution-and-anti-lock-in.md) | Accepted (2026-06-01) |
| Cross-dataset reconciliation as a reserved `comparison` check kind (reuse FastAPI_DataComparison engine; build post-v1; two-connection model → ADR 0015 pending) | [0014](docs/adr/0014-reconciliation-comparison-check-kind.md) | Accepted (2026-06-01) |

## 10. Critical pointers (easy to get wrong)

- **`pipeline_runs` ≠ `runs`.** Orchestrator pipeline executions live in `pipeline_runs`; DQ suite executions live in `runs`. They link via `triggered_by: '<provider>:<pipeline_or_dag_id>:<provider_run_id>'`.
- **`trigger_bindings` is provider-agnostic.** Composite key (`provider`, `pipeline_or_dag_id`, `env`) → `suite_id`. Don't add an ADF-specific bindings table.
- **PII redaction at the logger level**, not at every call site. The redactor sits in `backend/app/core/logging.py`.
- **Backward-compatible migrations only.** Code that depends on a new column ships in a separate PR *after* the migration is deployed.
- **The Week-3 threshold migration is a one-shot for schema seams.** It must also add `check.kind` (default `'expectation'`) and `results.metric_value` (NUMERIC) + `duration_ms` (INT) — see ADR `0012`. `metric_value` is the SQL-aggregatable scalar a monitor measured; **don't store metrics only in JSONB `observed_value`** (you can't `AVG()`/`STDDEV()` it for trends or anomaly baselines). Adding these later means a second backward-compat two-step.
- **Secret scanning in pre-commit AND CI.** Don't rely on one alone.
- **Azure Monitor alert setup (Week 7) needs the deployed public API URL.** Deployment must come first; coordinate Container Apps ingress with infra/security before Week 7 to avoid a deployment-day surprise.
- **MCP tool descriptions are LLM-facing, not REST-API-facing.** Write them for natural-language selection; test against the 4 canonical NL queries in the roadmap.

## 11. What NOT to do

- ❌ Don't add ADF or Airflow as a queryable datasource in the connection editor / check editor / suite model.
- ❌ Don't bypass the `OrchestrationProvider` abstraction with provider-specific branching in service code.
- ❌ Don't deepen Azure lock-in: no reading MSAL/Entra claims in route/service code (depend on the generic `get_current_user`), no hardcoded Azure resource names/endpoints in business logic, no Azure-only assumptions baked into container images. Azure is one impl behind each seam — see ADR [0010](docs/adr/0010-provider-agnostic-infrastructure-seams.md) / [0013](docs/adr/0013-marketplace-distribution-and-anti-lock-in.md).
- ❌ Don't `git commit --no-verify` past hooks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue.
- ❌ Don't commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` as the template.
- ❌ Don't drop columns in the same PR as the code change that stops using them. Two-step it.
- ❌ Don't fix bugs silently. Raise a GitHub issue, then PR with `Fixes #N`.
- ❌ Don't batch unrelated changes into one commit. One functionality per commit.
- ❌ Don't track GX Core at "latest." Pin the version in `environment.yml` — GX v1 API has drifted across point releases.
- ❌ Don't use venv or poetry for backend dev. Conda only.
- ❌ Don't write the MCP layer before Week 7. The service layer must stabilise first.

## 13. Status & current milestone

> **Detailed task-level status** lives in [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) — mirrors the 100-task roadmap, updated per PR. This section carries only the headline.

**Current week:** Week 2 — Connection manager (backend). Week 1 exit gate **met**.
**Week-1 exit gate:** A logged-in user can hit a FastAPI endpoint that triggers GX against Snowflake DEV and persists a result row. — **met** via `POST /api/v1/_probe/snowflake-suite` → Celery `run_suite` → `run_service` → `results`. Live run against Snowflake DEV fails-soft pending creds (deferred smoke).
**Completed since project start (2026-05-24):**
- PR 0 governance bundle (#1–#24, #44, #55) — onboarding docs, ADRs, CODEOWNERS, templates, Entire CLI hooks
- PR 1 (#37) — coding structure & tooling lock
- PR 2 a/b/c (#39, #40, #41) — Docker Compose, structlog + error envelope + FastAPI skeleton, SQLAlchemy models + Alembic baseline
- PR 3 a/b/c (#53, #56, #63) — Azure AD SSO end-to-end (backend MSAL + SecretStore abstraction + frontend MSAL + `/me`)
- PR 4 a/b/b.1/c (#74, #76, #77, #78, #79) — async backbone (Celery + containerized API/worker), Snowflake GX adapter, run/result persistence + NaN sanitizer, Postgres test fixtures, `_probe/snowflake-suite` endpoint. Coverage ~91%.
- ADRs 0006/0007 (#84) — orchestration-auth decisions (ADF secret-in-URL + hard-cutover; Airflow HMAC + polling fallback); #72 closed (#83) — `trigger_bindings` single-orchestrator assumption documented in ADR 0004.
- PR 5 (#85, merged) — Snowflake connection CRUD + `/test` endpoint; introduced the `ConnectionAdapter` seam + registry and `SecretStore.set` write-through. Coverage ~94%.
- ADRs 0005/0012 (accepted W2) — severity tier weights (0.5/1.0/2.0 + SQL-normalised health score) and the monitor-kind seam (`check.kind` + `metric_value`/`duration_ms`); both ride the one-shot Week-3 threshold migration. Closes the last Week-3 design gates.
**Next milestone:** PR 6 — ADF connection CRUD + `(type, env)` uniqueness guard (per #72) (Week 2).
**Active blockers:** none. See [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) for the active-issues list.

Update this section at the end of each week with: current week, the week's exit gate, and any open blocker issues by number. Per-PR task ticks go in `docs/progress.md` (PR-template checkbox).
